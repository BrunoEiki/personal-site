**Ursula K. Le Guin: Ideal schedule:**

    5:30 a.m. - wake up and lie there and think.

    6:15 a.m. - get up and eat breakfast (lots).

    7:15 a.m. - get to work writing, writing, writing.

    Noon - lunch.

    1-3 p.m. - reading, music.

    3-5 p.m. - correspondence, maybe house cleaning.

    5-8 p.m. - make dinner and eat it.

    After 8 p.m. - I tend to be very stupid and we won't talk about this.

I go to bed at 10:00 p.m. If I'm at the beach there would be one or two long walks on the beach in that day. This is a perfect day for me.
