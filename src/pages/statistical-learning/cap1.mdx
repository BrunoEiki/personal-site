    <p>
    Probably the most damning word is probably. Two thousand years ago the 
    Romans had the word probabilis. If something was probabilis then it 
    could be proved by experiment, because the two words come from the same 
    root: probare. But probabilis got overused. People are always more certain 
    of things than they really should be, and that applied to the Romans just 
    as much as to us. Roman lawyers would claim that their case was probabilis, 
    when it wasn’t. Roman astrologers would say that their predictions were 
    probabilis when they weren’t. [...] So by the time poor 
    probably first turned up in English in 1387 it was already a poor, exhausted 
    word whose best days were behind it, and only meant likely.
